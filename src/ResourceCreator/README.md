The `BadEcho.ResourceCreator` tool is used to generate **.resources** files that contain files that we wish to bundle as resources for a program. The resulting **.resources** files created by this tool can be compiled as embedded resources and then loaded through the use of a `ResourceManager`.

Visual Studio's built-in code generator for **.resx** files fails to function correctly when it comes to embedding audio resources. Manual creation of a **.resources** file with this tool allows the loading of audio assets by a program to be both possible and fairly simple.

This is a dotnet tool, with the command name `resource-creator`.

## About Bad Echo
Bad Echo is a collection of software technologies and [various writings](https://badecho.com) by Matt Weber: a software designer, partnered [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/omni) streamer, and game developer.

While Bad Echo code concerns itself a great deal with the "best approaches" to general software problems, its ultimate focus and goal is to provide entertainment through the clever manipulation of games and the creation of new ones.

## Getting in Contact
I'm a partnered Twitch streamer, and talking to me during one of my [Omnified streams](https://twitch.tv/omni), on the off chance that I actually _am_ streaming, is most definitely the quickest way to get my attention!
